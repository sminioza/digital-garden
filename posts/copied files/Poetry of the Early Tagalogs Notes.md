# Form

## Generally
1) Heptasyllabic
	- "heptasyllabic"
		- Iamb Anapest Iamb (my most common reading)
			- x / |  x x / | x /
			- **Halimbawa**: Ap<u>at</u> capa<u>pang</u> co<u>mot</u>
		- Some Iamb Iamb Anapest or Anapest Iamb Iamb
			- **Halimbawa**:

				- magda<u>mag</u> i<u>ni</u>li<u>pot</u>.
					- x x / | x / | x / (anapest iamb iamb)
	- Lumbera; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (230) "it seems fairly certain that the heptasyllabic line is an indigenous measure. As a poetic measure for a language abounding in polysyllabic words, it accounts to a great extent for the cryptic and gnomic quality of ancient riddles and proverbs"
		- Octosyllabic may be spanish modification; at the time was considered "national meter par excellence" (238) in Spain
1) AAAA Rhyme schemes most common (acting as heroic couplets in riddles/proverbs)

	- Modern orthography: Kinain na't naubos/ nabubuo pang lubos
		- x x / | x x / / (x ??)
- Lumbera; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (227) "The first line gives a general impression of the subjet, usually stated in metaphorical terms. The second line presents a clue that only seems to complicate the problem created in the first"
## Proverbs
- Couplets
- Slightly unbalanced meters more common
## Short Poems
- Quatrains
- AAAA common
	- sometimes AAAB or ABAB

## Narrative Poetry
FROM POETRY OF THE EARLY TAGALOGS PAPER ONLY SO FAR
- Lumbera quoting Pedro Chirino; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (245) "En estos cantares barbaros cuentan las fabulosos genealogias y vanos hechos de sus dioses."
- Lumbera quoting *Vocabulario*; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (245) about a "Pamatbat" "lo que cantan en sus embarcaciones a manera de historia, o cuando beben."
	- According to Lumbera, "not one exampe of the *pamatbat* has been preserved."
# Concepts
## Generally
1) Oral derivation of poems develops particular adaptations
	1) Necessitates immediate clarity
		- Lumbera; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (240) "When poetry is oral, language is used as a medium of communication, and rhetorical ornaments are kept at a minimum lest they impede the transfer of theme or sentiment from poem to audience ... the spoken poem cannot be contemplated at length the way a printed poem may be. The effectiveness of the poem depends upon the immediacy with which it draws response from the audience. If it is not grasped at the moment of performance, then the poem is likely to get lost."
	- Lumbera, quoting Pedro Chirino; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (244) "The traditions of government and religion were preserved in songs learned from childhood and heard over and over again when the natives sailed at sea, workedi n the fields, caroused at their festivities, or mourned their dead"
	1) Rhyming, meter kept relatively simple and consistent (AAAA, 7|7) to be memorable
	2) Parallelism and balance fundamental
	3) Familiar objects necessary to relate oral language to visual senses
2) Grounded in the body, the environment, the daily life
3) Thematically *Vocabulario* limited by christian missionaries' historiographical bias; poems selected by missionaries likely were those that best supported christian ideals, therefore not necessarily wholy representative of indigenous tagalog ideals
	- Lumbera, quoting Manuel Artigas y Cuerva quoting Juan Lopez; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (242) "A Dominican historian during the seventeenth century, however, speaks of 'dirty songs' sung by natives while hauling timber, crushing rocks or rowing boats."
- Abstract concepts rarely addressed directly
	- Lumbera; Poetry of the Early Tagalogs (243) "It does not talk about loneliness; it speaks of a piece of thread severed from the bobbin. It does not deal with pride as an idea; it talks about a coconut tree towering above other trees but hollowed by a pest burrowing within the trnuk"
## Riddles
1) Lumbera
	- Poetry of the Early Tagalog
		- (225) "(a riddle) demands active collaboration from the audience. In working out the solution, the audience actually participates in the original act of the creation when he pieces together the answer out of the clues given in the riddle."
		- (228) "As poets, the creators of riddles were in close contact with the life around them. The riddles are direct transcriptions of experience, communicating the feel of the life that motivated their creation. The tasks of folk-rowing, fishing, fetching water, reaping grain, plowing, cooking, etc. -- are reflected by the subjects and metaphors used, revealing a poetic sensibility keenly responsive to the environment."
		- (228) "Common objects are exaggerated when described, but there is no attempt to glamorize the commonplace. The tendecy, as a matter of fact, is always to pull down to earth (through the answer) what the imagination has raised to the level of fantasy"
		- quoting George Herzog (231) "the wide range of applicability and the ease with which the meaning of a proverb can at times shade into its opposite, suggest that in Africa the use of proverbs may become an intricate and artistic intellectual exercise, for the adept."
## Proverbs
1) Lumbera
	- Poetry of the Early Tagalogs
		- (232) "whereas the riddle draws the audience into a reenactment within himself of the creative process that took place within the riddler, the proverb requires a passive audience so that it can fulfill its function."
		- (234) "The eye for the marvelous, a special gift of the riddler, is replaced by an eye for the pertinent detail in keeping with the didatic function of the proverb."
## Short Poems
- referred to as <u>tanaga</u>
1) Lumbera
	- Poetry of the Early Tagalogs
		- Talinghaga
			- singular centrael metaphor between human experience and inhuman environment (inhuman insofar as existing outside of oneself)
			- the *Vocabulario* associates (it) with mystery, obscurity, and parabolic speech"
		- (236) "For the early Tagalog poets, it was not enough to use language in giving utterance to feelings and thoughts; they had to find situations in life or objects in Nature that produced in the poets effects similar to what they wanted to express. For them, figurative language was not poetic ornamentation but the necessary elaboration of a part of human experience seeking out analogies in life and Nature."
			- (235) "The centrality of the *talinghaga* to early Tagalog poetry seems to have been dictated by an instinctive recognition of the complexity of human experience which verbalization does not always capture. Words can give a nam to the experience, but the poet has to depend on analogues in order to suggest the unnameable aspects of experience."
				- quoting Wayne Shumaker (236) "the language of literature, in precisely those ways in which it differs from nonliterary language, tends strikingly to resemble the languages spoken by many savages. It is concrete, specific, sensory, and it prefers to delineation of particular instances to the statement of abstract truths. It often registers percepts in clusters and does not ... separate out for attention whatever strands of adjacent objects are conceptually related. On the contrary, it regards contiguity as proof of mutual involvement--'uncritically,' it would appear to the logical thinker"
		- greater emotive and mindful expression than proverbs
		- subordinate clause first two lines main clause second two
		- Octosyllabic does differ in form to heptasyllabic
			- Tanaga often not present
				- central metaphor/image "particular, not generalized" (239)
			- from my reading much darker tone, a lot more depressing or serious
		- (243) "Tagalog folk poetry had roots in the riddle and the proverb and was written in quatrains, each quatrain containing a single metaphor drawn from the commonplace of rural life."
